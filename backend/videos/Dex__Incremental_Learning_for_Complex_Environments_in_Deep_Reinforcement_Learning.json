  "summary": "This paper introduces Dex, a reinforcement learning environment toolkit special- Complex environments such as Go, Starcraft, and many modern video-games present profound challenges in deep reinforcement learning that have yet to be solved. They often require long, precisesequences of actions and domain knowledge in order to obtain reward. Solutions to these problems would mark a signi\ufb01cant breakthrough on the path to general intelligence. As environments become more complex, they will become more expensive to simulate.",
